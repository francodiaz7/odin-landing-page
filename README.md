## About

A simple webpage project using Flexbox made during the foundations course on The Odin Project.
## Thoughts

This was my second project assignment with The Odin Project curriculum. It was rewarding seeing a page coming to life with the knowledge of previous lessons, especially considering that flexbox was a concept a little hard to grasp at first. During this project I learned how to build a webpage with flexbox, use different types of flex-direction, and the triforce of flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.

It was wonderful starting the blank project with confidence after completing some flexbox exercise, and little by little it started to gain shape, till the final version.
